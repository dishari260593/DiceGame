GAME RULES:

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
In each turn, a player rolls two dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
ALSO, if the player rolls two sixes in a throw, all his ROUND score and his OVERALL score get lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
Anytime during the ROUND a player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his OVERALL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
The first player to reach the WINNING SCORE (Default 100 points) on the OVERALL score wins the game
